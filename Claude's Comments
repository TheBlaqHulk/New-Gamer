The code is functional and does what needs to be done, the graphics and musical element are a good touch.
The javascript code is slightly cramped, with a lot of processes being taken care of by one function, that is my only criticism of this body of good work.
A use of images in place of the letters would also be cool.
Comments on the code would also be a good idea and aid to understanding the code.
